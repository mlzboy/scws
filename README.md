Why we need a new web shell?
----------------------------

Now the web shells are all enough to use, but a bit ugly. And, they all use the old ways to develop it, like php. It will cause a waste of flow and needs plenty of time to load the page. Now something has changed!

SCWS is supposed to be a web shell that provides cute and easy user interface, and it use AJAX for almost everything. It is a powerful C/S model.

What's the advantages?
----------------------

You won't need to load the similar page again and agian. You will see cool effects while loading, but not just refresh.

USAGE
=====

SCWS is under Bottle framework of python. To run, just type:
```Bash
$python webshell.py
Bottle v0.12-dev server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
Listening on http://localhost:8080/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.

```
Now open the browser and visit http://localhost:8080/ws
